###### LAST UPDATED: May 31, 2022

In May 2022, reporters from The Charlotte Observer and The News & Observer [published a series of stories](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/topics/security_for_sale) highlighting the rise of the single-family home rental industry in North Carolina.

The work was funded in part by the [Pulitzer Center](https://pulitzercenter.org/), which invested not only in the journalism, but in the creation of a toolkit for newsrooms looking to replicate and expand upon the two papers' reporting in their own markets.

Not all of the lessons learned during the Observer and N&O's six months spent tracking and documenting large single-family rental companies in North Carolina will apply to every market. But because this industry has standardized the way it buys and manages homes across the country to increase its profit margins at scale, many techniques will be similar whether you're covering Charlotte or Chula Vista, Raleigh or Richmond.

## Who this toolkit is for

We've designed this toolkit for local and national journalists at a variety of skill levels who are interested in probing the extent of corporate homeownership in their cities, regions and states.

Some experience working with data will be helpful, but we've also put together entry-level tutorials using basic spreadsheet functions (usable in Google Sheets or Excel). More advanced users may prefer tutorials using R, a statistical programming language.

Our overarching goal is to make this guide as accessible as possible, so if you get stuck, let us know. We're continuing to improve the content here to make it easier to use.

Although this toolkit is geared toward journalists, its use isn't limited to newsrooms. Members of the public, academics and researchers are welcome.

## How to use this toolkit
This site is divided up into two broad sections: **tutorials** and **resources**.

**Resources** contain the background materials, like readings lists and glossaries, that can help add context to your reporting and understanding of corporate homeownership.

**Tutorials**, organized by **beginner**, **intermediate** and **advanced**, provide technical walkthroughs for different aspects of the project, like how to match the names of the various holding companies to their parent companies.

**Beginner** tutorials are largely written for Excel and Google Sheets users, while **intermediate** and **advanced** tutorials are written for R users.
