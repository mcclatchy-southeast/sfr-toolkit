###### LAST UPDATED: May 31, 2022

In May 2022, reporters from The Charlotte Observer and The News & Observer [published a series of stories](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/topics/security_for_sale) highlighting the rise of the single-family home rental industry in North Carolina.

The work was funded in part by the [Pulitzer Center](https://pulitzercenter.org/), which invested not only in the journalism, but in the creation of a toolkit for newsrooms looking to replicate and expand upon the two papers' reporting in their own markets.

Not all of the lessons learned during the Observer and N&O's six months spent tracking and documenting large single-family rental companies in North Carolina will apply to every market. But because this industry has standardized the way it buys and manages homes across the country to increase its profit margins at scale, many techniques will be similar whether you're covering Charlotte or Chula Vista, Raleigh or Richmond.

## Who this toolkit is for

We've designed this toolkit for local and national journalists at a variety of skill levels who are interested in probing the extent of corporate homeownership in their cities, regions and states.

Some experience working with data will be helpful, but we've also put together entry-level tutorials using basic spreadsheet functions (usable in Google Sheets or Excel). More advanced users may prefer tutorials using R, a statistical programming language.

Our overarching goal is to make this guide as accessible as possible, so if you get stuck, let us know. We're continuing to improve the content here to make it easier to use.

Although this toolkit is geared toward journalists, its use isn't limited to newsrooms. Members of the public, academics and researchers are welcome.

## How to use this toolkit
This site is divided up into two broad sections: **tutorials** and **resources**.

**Resources** contain the background materials, like readings lists and glossaries, that can help add context to your reporting and understanding of corporate homeownership.

**Tutorials**, organized by **beginner**, **intermediate** and **advanced**, provide technical walkthroughs for different aspects of the project, like how to match the names of the various holding companies to their parent companies.

**Beginner** tutorials are largely written for Excel and Google Sheets users, while **intermediate** and **advanced** tutorials are written for R users.

## What you'll need

Before you get started, make sure you have the data and software/online accounts that can help you discover the scale of corporate homeownership in your community.

### Data and documents

#### Essential 
- **Property record data** Data on property ownership may be maintained on the county level, depending on your state. If it's not readily accessible your county website or GIS portal online, try requesting it from your local register of deeds or tax administration department.

- **Property sales/transaction data** Depending on the jurisdiction, data of property sales (like sale price and date) may be stored separately from data detailing the current owner of a parcel or property. You'll need this data if you plan to evaluate how many transactions involve a corporate landlord over a certain period of time. Even if property record data contains information on a home's sale price and date, if it sold multiple times over the time period you're studying (if was bought and flipped, for example), you'll miss every transaction before the most recent one.

#### Optional
 
 - **Rental property/landlord registrations** Some jurisdictions may require landlords of certain sizes to register basic information, like contact details, addresses or unit counts, for the purposes of public safety or code enforcement (North Carolina, by contrast, forbids municipalities from collecting this information). Check to see if you can request this data, which might allow you to quickly identify large landlords.

 - **Consumer complaints** States with consumer protection divisions (often housed within the office of the state attorney general), should be able to provide copies of complaints filed against corporate landlords. You'll probably have to submit a public records request for these documents for a specific list of companies over a specific time period. The records will provide the names of renters and, often, documentation of problems those renters have experienced.

### Technology

#### For beginning users
- **Google/Google Sheets** *(free)* If you have a personal Google account, or one through your newsroom's corporate/enterprise account, you can use [Google Sheets](http://sheet.new/) for free. Sheets replicates much of the functionality of Microsoft Excel (without the pricey subscription fee), but may be sluggish or glitchy when the data gets too large.

*OR*

- **Microsoft Excel** *($69.99/year)* Still largely the standard for spreadsheet work, Excel is more robust than Google Sheets, although the functionality is largely similar. It can handle bigger datasets (which may come in handy for large property record databases), and also allows you to keep data on your local machine without the need for a constant internet connection.

#### For intermediate/advanced users
- **R (free)** A statistical programming language that is quickly becoming one of the standard tools for data journalists around the world.

- **RStudio (free)** A popular integrated development environment (IDE) that essentially functions as a user interface for the R language itself.
