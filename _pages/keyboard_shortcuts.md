title: Keyboard shortcuts in R
---

A few common shortcuts in RStudio can save you from typing a lot of extra keystrokes.

<div class="alert alert-warning">NOTE: We're using <kbd>Command</kbd> here for Macs, but if you're using a Windows machine, substitute <kbd>Control</kbd>.</div>

### Execute a command
<kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>

Run a section of code in your R script.

### Input an assignment character
<kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd>

Input a `<-` at your cursor to assign output to a variable.

### Comment multiple lines
<kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

Highlight one or multiple lines of code and use this shortcut to comment them all out, preventing that section from executing.

### Input a pipe character
<kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>

When using the `tidyverse` library. Input the character sequence `%>%`, used to chain together different functions for more complex operations.
